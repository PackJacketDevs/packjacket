    <h2>User Input</h2>
    <p>If the checkbox to enable this feature is selected, you will be able to make your own text boxes, checkboxes, and other types of input on a panel and use them to get input from the user during installation. This is an optional feature. You can use the input you get here by using the variable name you specify, in any other part of PackJacket. A common place to use these variables is passing it as args in the Processes section.</p>
    <p><strong>Title</strong><br />
      The title of the screen/panel that will display the user inputs you ask for and allow them to enter values.</p>
    <p><strong>Bold</strong><br />
    Allows to make the title bold.</p>
    <p><strong>Italics</strong><br />
    Allows to make the title appear in italics.</p>
    <p><strong>Font Multiplier</strong><br />
Allows make the text bigger.</p>
    <p><strong>QuickXport User Input</strong><br />
    You can make all the user input data be written to a text file of your choice (specified with filename text field). This is a way that PackJacket makes including USer Input in your application's laucher easy.<br />
      <br />
      List Variable Values: Lists all the variable valuse in a list in the order specified in the User Input section.<br />
      Example:<br />
      <code>value1<br />
      value2<br />
      value3<br />
      value4<br />
      </code><br />
      List Variable Names and Values: Writes the variable name, then it's value, on the same line.<br />
      Example:<br />
      <code>varName1: value1<br />
      varName1: value2<br />
      varName1: value3<br />
      varName1: value4</code><br /> 
      <br />
